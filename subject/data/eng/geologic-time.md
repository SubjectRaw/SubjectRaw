+ ```details: Events``` Warm but cooling climate, moving towards Icehouse; Rapid evolution and diversification of fauna, especially mammals. Major evolution and dispersal of modern types of flowering plants

##### Neogene
+ ```details: Period type``` Period

###### Miocene
+ ```details: Period type``` Epoch
+ ```details: Events``` Moderate Icehouse climate, punctuated by ice ages; Orogeny in northern hemisphere. Modernmammal and bird families become recognizable.Horses and mastodons diverse. Grasses become ubiquitous. First apes appear (for reference see the article: Sahelanthropus tchadensis). Kaikoura Orogeny forms Southern Alps in New Zealand, continues today. Orogeny of the Alps in Europe slows, but continues to this day. Carpathian orogeny forms Carpathian Mountains in Central andEastern Europe. Hellenic orogeny in Greece and Aegean Sea slows, but continues to this day.Middle Miocene Disruption occurs. Widespread forests slowly draw in massive amounts of CO2, gradually lowering the level of atmospheric CO2from 650 ppmv down to around 100 ppmv.

###### Pliocene
+ ```details: Period type``` Epoch
+ ```details: Events``` Intensification of present Icehouse conditions,present (Quaternary) ice age begins roughly 2.58 Ma; cool and dry climate. Australopithecines, many of the existing genera of mammals, and recentmollusks appear. Homo habilis appears.

##### Quaternary
+ ```details: Period type``` Period

###### Pleistocene
+ ```details: Period type``` Epoch
+ ```details: Events``` Flourishing and then extinction of many largemammals (Pleistocene megafauna). Evolution of anatomically modern humans. Quaternary Ice Agecontinues with glaciations and interstadials (and the accompanying fluctuations from 100 to 300 ppmv inatmospheric CO2 levels), further intensification of Icehouse Earth conditions, roughly 1.6 Ma. Last glacial maximum (30000 years ago),last glacial period (18000–15000 years ago). Dawn of human stone-age cultures, with increasing technical complexity relative to previous ice age cultures, such as engravings and clay statues (e.g.Venus of Lespugue), particularly in theMediterranean and Europe. Lake Toba supervolcanoerupts 75000 years before present, causing avolcanic winter that pushes humanity to the brink of extinction. Pleistocene ends with Oldest Dryas,Older Dryas/Allerød and Younger Dryas climate events, with Younger Dryas forming the boundary with the Holocene.

###### Holocene

+ ```details: Start``` 0.0117 ```details: Unit``` Ma
+ ```details: Events``` Quaternary Ice Age recedes, and the currentinterglacial begins; rise of human civilization.Sahara forms from savannah, and agriculturebegins. Stone Age cultures give way to Bronze Age(3300 BC) and Iron Age (1200 BC), giving rise tomany pre-historic cultures throughout the world.Little Ice Age (stadial) causes brief cooling inNorthern Hemisphere from 1400 to 1850. Following the Industrial Revolution, Atmospheric CO2 levels rise from around 280 parts per million volume (ppmv) to the current level of 400 ppmv.
